# PREDICTING-DIABETES-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
End-to-end diabetes onset classifier using Pima Indians Diabetes dataset (Kaggle/UCI). Includes EDA, treating physiologically-impossible zeros as missing with median imputation, scaling, baseline &amp; tuned models (LogisticRegression, KNN, SVM, RandomForest) via GridSearchCV, evaluation and joblib export.
